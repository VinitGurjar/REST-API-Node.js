#### What is REST API :

A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.

The REST API uses HTTP requests to retrieve, update, and delete data. It is a type of software architecture that follows a set of constraints and principles to create a scalable and flexible web service.

REST APIs typically use HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources identified by URLs or URIs. Each resource is represented by a unique URL, and the state of the resource can be manipulated using the corresponding HTTP method.

### The primary characteristics of a RESTful API include:

- Stateless: The server does not maintain any client context between requests.

- Client-Server architecture: The client and server are separate entities, and each has its own responsibilities.

- Uniform interface: The API should have a standardized interface, which includes a unique resource identifier for each resource, a representation of the resource, and methods to manipulate the resource.

- Cacheable: The API should support caching to improve performance.

- Layered system: The API should support a layered system of components to improve scalability.

- Code on demand: The API should support the ability for the server to provide executable code to the client when needed.

- REST APIs are widely used by web developers to create scalable and flexible web applications that can be consumed by various client applications.
